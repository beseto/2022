**Objective:** Short videos were made to support caregivers in understanding key social behaviors. This study explores the effectiveness of using a visual aid in screening for autism spectrum disorder (ASD).  

**Methods:** Key behaviors were based on the Behavior Development Screening for Toddlers (BeDevel; Bong et al., 2021). Caregivers were asked to select which video their child resembled the most. The predictive value in screening for ASD was measured with the ROC curve analysis. Comparisons between the video and standardized interview were compared using kappa values(k).    
 
**Results:** 91 children with ASD (M=36.24, SD=5.86) and 30 children without ASD (M=32.37, SD=7.06) were included. Joint attention, pointing behavior, interactive social play, and eye contact showed good predictability (AUC range=0.710-0.751). There was a trend in the effectiveness of using short videos rather than the in-person interview for interactive social play (p=0.054). Kappa values ranged from 0.134-0.482.

**Conclusion:** Visual aids can be helpful to caregivers.
