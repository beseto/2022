Objective: This study aimed to compare the effects of Autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) and binaural beat (BB) on stress reduction.
Method: Subjects with stress were recruited considering their perceived stress scale (PSS), Beck depression inventory-II (BDI-II), insomnia severity index (ISI), and state-trait anxiety inventory-state anxiety (STAI-S) scores. Subjects listened to ASMR or BB with music (8Hz, 15minutes for daytime, 5Hz, 30 minutes for nighttime) for 3 weeks. QEEG was measured before and after the intervention.
Results: Seventy-six participants finished the trial. After the intervention, PSS, BDI-II, ISI, STAI-S, and PSQI scores improved significantly in both groups. Changes of absolute beta and high beta power in the ASMR group were larger than those in the BB group (p = 0.026, p = 0.040, respectively). 
Conclusion: ASMR and BB are equally effective in reducing stress. ASMR can lead to an increase in beta and high beta waves associated with cortical arousal.
