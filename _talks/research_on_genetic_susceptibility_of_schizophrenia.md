The strategy of genetics has been proven to be effective and helpful to explore the mechanism of schizophrenia and the molecular basis of antipsychotic medications. We have been committed to finding the susceptibility genes of schizophrenia in Chinese Han population. The major findings are as follows: 1) Using the genome-wide association study (GWAS) and meta- analysis, we have found several novel susceptible loci associated with the risk of schizophrenia (MTHFR, NKAPL, TSPAN18, etc.). Combined clues of bioinformatics data and functional experiments by using the gene knock-out or knock-in mice models, we further explored the potential function of the novel susceptible genes (Opcml, Nkapl, Auts2, etc.). 2) Using the multi-omics approaches, we found there were very important interactive effects on genetic polymorphisms or variants, on transcriptional levels or neuroimaging characters in schizophrenia patients. 3) With a large sample size of pharmacogenomics (3 stages-design, n = 5934), the applicant reported several susceptible genes associated with individual differences in therapeutic or side effects of common antipsychotic medicines. Patients in the pharmacogenomics-guided pharmacotherapy (PGT) group had greater early-response rate (94.0% versus 80.8%), response rate (83.1% versus 60.3%) and symptomatic remission rate (68.7% versus 46.2%) compared to the treatment-as-usual (TAU group. These results will be helpful to interpret the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, as well as the pharmacological mechanism of common antipsychotic medications.
