Objective. Identifying neurodevelopmental differences in subtypes of patients with obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is critical for understanding complexities of the disorder and establishing biological evidence-based homogeneous subtypes in this heterogeneous population.
Methods. We compared whole-brain cortical gyrification in 84 patients with early-onset OCD, 84 patients with late-onset OCD, and 152 healthy controls using the local gyrification index (lGI). Then, the relationships between lGI in clusters showing significant differences and performance of trait-related neurocognitive function impairments in OCD was further examined in early-onset OCD patients.
Results. The early-onset OCD patients exhibited significantly greater gyrification than those with late-onset OCD patients and healthy controls in frontoparietal and cingulate regions. Moreover, impaired neurocognitive functions in early-onset OCD patients were correlated with increased gyrification.
Conclusion. Our findings provide a neurobiological marker to distinguish the OCD population into more neurodevelopmentally homogeneous subtypes, which may contribute to the understanding of the neurodevelopmental underpinnings of an etiology.
