The present study aims to explore the segregation of the emotion dysregulation (ED) in adults with ADHD (aADHD) from the status of co-morbid MDD, focusing on the abnormal resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) of the amygdala subregions. A total of 80 aADHD co-morbid with MDD (aADHD+MDD), 170 aADHD without co-morbid MDD (aADHD-MDD) and 64 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited. Group comparisons revealed rs-FCs associated with aADHD-MDD and/or aADHD+MDD. Correlation analyses indicated a positive correlation between ED and higher FC between left superficial amygdala area and right inferior temporal gyrus (r = 0.20, p = 0.016), which is specific to ADHD and positively correlated with ADHD core symptoms (r = 0.17, p = 0.040, for inattention; r = 0.19, p = 0.021, for hyperactivity/impulsivity). The results suggested that ED should be the inherent feature of ADHD, rather than that could be explained by the comorbidity of MDD from the neuroimaging prospect.
