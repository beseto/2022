For a psychiatrist, pathological diagnosis is almost the only way to observe the tissue of the lesion. In actual, the diagnostic accuracy of LBD is only 79.7%, and 20% has other pathology such as progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, or vascular dementia. Clinical diagnostic criteria are designed to match the pathological diagnosis as closely as possible, but some diagnostic criteria, such as FTLD, are based on the assumption that it is impossible to extract a group of patients having the same single pathology (e.g. Of 117 FTLD cases, only 63 cases were FTLD-TDP in Manchester Brain Bank (Baborie, 2010)). Clinical diagnosis is sometimes not accurate. So, by autopsy, we should check whether the clinical diagnosis was "adequate" in order to keep on improving our empirical diagnostic ability.

In this presentation, we are going to show the statistical data of clinicopathological correlation of neurocognitive diseases from the perspective of diagnostic accuracy, though it may have some methodological limitations especially in defining diagnostic "correctness" in the neuropathological field.

The result shows the apparent difficulty in diagnosing or predicting some kind of tauopathy or TDP-43 proteinopathy, whereas clinicians almost perfectly diagnose the diagnosis of multiple system atrophy. Moreover, the autopsy results tell us how badly we are overlooking double pathology cases.

Let us not skip examinations such as PET, MIBG, or CSF test, if possible, in order to diagnose more accurately. And, let us not hesitate to re-check the clinical diagnosis by autopsy if the bereaved family may allow it.
