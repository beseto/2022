Schizophrenia is a complex disorder with diverse underlying factors. Due to its complexity, the pathophysiology of schizophrenia remains elusive rendering detection, diagnosis and treatment challenging. Metabolic profiling is a technique that provides mechanistic insight into disease pathology because the metabolite status reflects the pathophysiological status. This approach contributes to uncovering schizophrenia’s pathophysiology. Betaine is a choline metabolite with imperative peripheral and central roles. Research has shown that betaine concentrations are altered in schizophrenia patients. However, the relationship between betaine and schizophrenia remains ambiguous. The present study investigated this relationship by examining the impact of betaine levels on brain volume. In a sample of 76 participants (27 patients), we found that the effects of Betaine on brain volume are group-specific, and significant correlations between Betaine and notable brain areas implicated in schizophrenia’s pathology such as the STG. These findings suggest that Betaine levels may contribute to aberrant structural changes in schizophrenia.
