Previous cross-sectional studies have reported that dissociative symptoms (DIS) are associated with self-harm (SH). We aimed to investigate the longitudinal relationship between DIS and SH in general adolescent population. 
We used data from the Tokyo Teen Cohort study (N=3007). DIS were assessed with CBCL, and SH was self-reported at the age of 12 and 14. Pathological dissociation (PD) was defined as a score above the top 10 percentile. The longitudinal relationship between DIS and SH was examined using regression analyses 
DIS at T1 tended to predict SH at T2 (OR 1.11, p=0.08), while SH at T1 did not predict DIS at T2. Compared with adolescents without any PD, those with persistent PD had an increased risk of SH at T2 (OR 2.61, p=0.01). 
DIS tended to predict future SH. Intensive attention should be given to adolescents with persistent PD due to their increased risk of SH.
