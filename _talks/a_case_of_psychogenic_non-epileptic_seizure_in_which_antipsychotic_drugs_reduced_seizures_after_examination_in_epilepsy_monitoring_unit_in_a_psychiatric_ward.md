A woman in her 40s with recurrent convulsive seizures postulated to be caused by interpersonal stress was admitted to our Epilepsy Care Unit with suspected PNES. She was admitted to the Epilepsy Center twice for detailed examination but was interrupted due to problems with the ward staff. She was able to continue her hospitalization at our hospital. EEG showed no epileptic abnormal waves, and SPECT, PET, MRI, and magnetoencephalography showed no apparent abnormalities. Psychological examination revealed high scores on the Hysteria Scale and the Depression Scale. A small dose of antipsychotic medication was introduced for emotional instability, and the patient was seizure-free for the next six months. A psychiatry-based Epilepsy Care Unit could provide a safe environment for a well-timed examination and diagnosis of patients with emotional instability. In addition, small doses of antipsychotics may be effective for the emotional instability that underlies psychogenic non-epileptic seizures and may reduce seizures.
