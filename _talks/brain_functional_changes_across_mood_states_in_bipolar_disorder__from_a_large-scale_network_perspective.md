Bipolar disorder (BD) is characterized by fluctuations of opposing moods (elevated and depressed mood state) with shifts between pathologic and euthymic states. However, research on resting-state functional changes related to mood states has been limited and divergent. Here, we primarily aimed to investigate large-scale brain network disturbances across mood states using a cross-sectional case-control design and a longitudinal design, with secondary analyses examining topological properties of brain regions using graph theory-based approaches. Compared to patients in depressive and euthymic states and healthy controls, manic/hypomanic patients showed increased between-network functional connectivity (FC) in the visual network and the default mode network (DMN). During mania/hypomania, patients showed increased FC between the DMN and the ventral attention network. The manic/hypomanic patients exhibited increased nodal degree in left parietal operculum, right somatomotor cortex and posterior dorsal attention network, and in bilateral parietal DMN and precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex. Collectively, our findings demonstrated a brain network signature and possible hub relevant for (hypo)mania.
