Objective: Although ASD seems to be under the influence of a strong genetic etiology, the concordance rate of identical twins is reported to be around 60%, and since the concordance rate is not 100%, environmental factors can also be considered. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prenatal and perinatal history of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) as compared to unaffected siblings (SIB). Methods: Subjects with ASD and their SIB were recruited. All subjects were assessed using both the Korean version of Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (K-ADI-R) and the Korean version of Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (K-ADOS) and were subsequently identified as affected or unaffected. Prenatal and perinatal  history was obtained from the primary caregivers and each facet was compared in those with ASD and the SIB groups using SPSS ver. 25.0 (p<.05).
Results: 875 individuals with ASD (143 females, 87.87±42.35months), 244 SIB (135 females, 91.52±32.01 months) were analyzed. The ASD group showed significantly higher rates of neonatal jaundice (χ2=6.620, p=.010, OR=1.721), insufficient MMR vaccination (χ2=11.532, p=.001, OR=1.808) and tic symptoms (χ2=13.086, p=.000, OR=5.38). Differences in the frequency of seizure, birth trauma, respiratory distress and motor dysfunction at birth were not significantly different among the two groups.
Conclusion: These results indicate that perinatal and prenatal factors may contribute to the development of ASD. The results imply that rather than being a single cause, environmental factors are also important in the ASD group or suggest the presence of gene-environment interactions. Large-scale prospective studies are needed.
