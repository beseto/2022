Objective: Primary age-related tauopathy (PART) is a neuropathological entity with neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the absence of beta-amyloid (Aβ) plaques in the brain. We tried to investigate the frequency and rate of cognitive decline in older adults with PART defined by neuroimaging biomarkers.
Methods: A total of 161 older individuals were included in the analysis. PART was defined when SUVR value of mean global Aβ deposition is less than 1.4 (Aβ negative) and tau burden corresponds to Braak stage I-IV. 
Results: Among 161 participants, 51 (31.7%) were classified as PART, 31 (19.3 %) as no Alzheimer's disease (AD)-pathology, and 79 (49.1%) as AD. In regard to cognitive change rate, PART was similar to no-AD pathology with a relatively stable course which was significantly slower than AD. 
Conclusion: Our findings indicate that PART is relatively common in older adults and PART appears closer to no-AD pathology condition rather than AD.
