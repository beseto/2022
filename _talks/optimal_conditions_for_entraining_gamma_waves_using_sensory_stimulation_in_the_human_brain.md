Gamma entrainment using flickering light stimulation (FLS), which was found to reduce Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) pathologies in AD-modeled mice, may be influenced by the microstructural integrity of white matter tracts in humans. We measured the resting state EEG and the steady state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) of gamma rhythms induced by FLS. We analyzed the entrainment and connectivity of gamma rhythms and acquired the diffusion tensor images and measured the fractional anisotropy (FA) of the white matter tracts of interest.
We included 26 participants in the final analysis after excluding five participants who showed the SSVEP deficit. The FAs of middle longitudinal fasciculus and superior longitudinal fasciculus the gamma rhythm connectivity from occipital to temporal, central and cortices were statistically significant in both hemispheres (p < 0.05).
In future clinical trials on the gamma entrainment using FLS, the white matter microstructural integrity should be considered in selecting study participants.
