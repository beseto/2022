The Asian Consortium on MRI studies in Psychosis (ACMP) is the first Asian international multi-center clinical neuroimaging study in psychiatry launched 2017. Although there has been a long delay in data sharing due to ethical review approval and COVID pandemic, we have started to share structural data for 1095 individuals with schizophrenia spectrum and 834 healthy controls from 8 sites. The MRI data were preprocessed using the same procedure and harmonized using ComBat GAM. The clinical data were standardized and shared. We will keep updating the data for the other pending projects and are happy to accept new applications from the members. In addition, in this symposium we will briefly present an example of approved research projects of the ACMP, entitled “Subcortical volumetric lateralization in schizophrenia.” Subcortical structures not only play key roles in cognition, emotion, and volition, but also contribute to high-order executive functions. We recently demonstrated a leftward asymmetry for globus pallidus volume in patients with schizophrenia, using a large-scale structural MRI data sets of Japanese individuals. This finding was replicated also in high-risk patients and adolescents with subclinical psychotic experiences. It is, however, yet to be seen whether it is found in early psychosis or across ethnicities/countries. Thus, to address this question, we have started our current project in the framework of the ACMP.
