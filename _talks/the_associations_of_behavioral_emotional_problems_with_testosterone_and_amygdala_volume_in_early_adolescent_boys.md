Adolescence is a time of transition from childhood to adulthood, during which people experience great physiological and psychosocial changes. As such, it is also a time of increased risk for psychiatric disorders and psychobehavioral problems. Notable biological changes during this period include sex hormone surges and brain remodeling. However, it is unclear exactly how and when these processes mediate psychobehavioral features. Especially, recent studies suggest testosterone and amygdala are interrelatedly influencing on emotions and behaviors. Here, using a population-based cohort of early adolescent boys, we investigated the associations of various psychobehavioral problems with testosterone and amygdala volume at two timepoints (wave 1: 10-11 y.o. and wave 2: 12-13 y.o.). In wave 1, both internalizing and externalizing problems were negatively correlated with testosterone. In wave 2, internalizing problems were negatively correlated with right amygdala volume. These results suggest that the biological processes governing psychobehavioral problems may transition in time-dependent manner.
