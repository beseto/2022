Auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) are a core positive symptom of schizophrenia and are regarded as a consequence of the functional breakdown in the related sensory process. Yet, the potential mechanism of AVH is still lacking. 
In the present study, we explored the difference between AVHs (n = 23) and non-AVHs (n = 19) in schizophrenia and healthy controls (n = 29) by using multidimensional electroencephalograms data during an auditory oddball task. Comparing to healthy controls, both AVH and non-AVH groups showed reduced P300 amplitudes. Even more, brain networks analysis results found AVH patients showed reduced left frontal to posterior parietal/temporal connectivity than non-AVH patients. Moreover, when using the fused network properties of both delta and theta bands as features for in-depth learning, it was possible to identify the AVH from non-AVH patients at an accuracy of 80.95%. 
The left frontal-parietal/temporal networks seen in the auditory oddball paradigm might be underlying biomarkers of AVH in schizophrenia. This study demonstrated for the first time the functional breakdown of the auditory processing pathway in the AVH patients, leading to a better understanding of the atypical brain network of the AVH.
