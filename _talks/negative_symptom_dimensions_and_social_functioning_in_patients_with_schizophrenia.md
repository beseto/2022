Negative symptoms seriously affect social functioning in patients with schizophrenia. We applied a cross-sectional study enrolling 202 participants with schizophrenia to uncover the relationship between dimensional negative symptoms and social functioning. Negative symptoms and social functioning were evaluated using the Negative Symptom Assessment and the Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP) total score and employment status. Correlation analysis was conducted to clarify the relationship between negative symptoms and the PSP total score. Regression analysis was performed to explore the determinants of the PSP total score and employment status, considering negative symptoms and possible confounders. We found that the PSP total score was correlated with all three dimensions of negative symptoms (emotion, motivation, and communication). Poor motivation significantly predicted low PSP total scores and unemployment. In conclusion, social functioning was significantly related to motivation, which is considered as a potential therapeutic target to improve patientsâ€™ social functioning.
