Depression causes a heavy burden in adolescent life. Being praised for prosocial behavior might be a preventive factor because both being praised and prosocial behavior are protective against depression. Here, we investigated the longitudinal relationship between being praised for prosocial behavior and depressive symptoms in adolescents. In the Tokyo Teen Cohort study (TTC), we collected 3,171 adolescents’ data on self-reported experiences of being praised for prosocial behavior, depressive symptoms, and caregiver-evaluated prosocial behavior. The experience of praise was assessed by whether the responses to the open-ended question, "What are you praised for?" included prosocial behavior. Multiple linear regression indicated that being praised for prosocial behavior at age 10 was associated with less severe depressive symptoms at age 12. This association remained significant after adjusting for confounders, including baseline depressive symptoms. Prosocial behavior alone was not associated with depressive symptoms. Praise for adolescents’ prosocial behavior can be encouraged to prevent depression
