Insomnia is the second most common mental disorder. Sleep is characterized by dynamic variations in brain activity over time. The brain function during sleep may display impairments in patients with insomnia, However, most functional imaging study was conducted in daytime wakefulness. Progress in our understanding of brain dysfunctions in insomnia across wakefulness and different sleep stages has been limited. Using simultaneous EEG-fMRI can identify the brain functional networks across wakefulness and different stages. With this advantage, we can also illustrate the brain activation in relation to characteristic sleep events, such as spindles. Our findings suggest that the prominent abnormal neural representation observed across wakefulness and sleep that characterizes the coordination between the limbic system and arousal structures may hinder the maintenance of sleep in insomnia.
