**Objective:** To define the frailty definition, describe incidence and its distribution, and to explore risk factors.

**Methods:** A 15-year follow-up study was conducted in 2022 participants aged 65 years and over in Beijing, China. Three evaluation criteria of frailty were constructed. The incidence of dementia was calculated, and the risk factors of dementia were analyzed. 

**Results:** The 15-year cumulative incidence of dementia was 14.94%, the incidence density was 25.02/1000 person-years. The behavioral and psychological symptoms (RR=2.247, 95% CI:1.500-3.151), depression (RR=2.110, 95% CI: 1.365-3.038), frailty defined by physical frailty index (PFI) (RR=1.514, 95% CI:1.123-1.997) and frailty defined by multidimensional frailty index (MFI) (RR=1.669, 95% CI:1.312-2.059) were risk factors of dementia, fish consumption was a protective factor of dementia (RR=0.749,95% CI:0.574-0.970).

**Conclusion:** Depression, behavioral and psychological symptoms, frailty defined by PFI and MFI increase the risk of dementia, and regular consumption of fish reduce the risk of dementia.
