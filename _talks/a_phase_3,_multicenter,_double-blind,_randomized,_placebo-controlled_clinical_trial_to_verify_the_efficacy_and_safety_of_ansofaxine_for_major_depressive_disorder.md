Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the most prevalent form of depression and is 
becoming a great challenge for public health and medical practice.A multicenter, double
blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 clinical trial was conducted in patients 
with MDD in China to assess the efficacy and safety of ansofaxine (LY03005), a 
potential triple reuptake inhibitor of serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine. Eligible 
588 MDD patients were included and randomly assigned (1:1:1) to 8-week treatment 
with ansofaxine 80 mg/day(n=187), ansofaxine 160 mg/day(n=186), or placebo(n=185). 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the MADRS total score change from baseline to the 
end of the study. Safety indexes included adverse events, vital signs, physical 
examinations, laboratory tests, 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECG) and evaluation of 
suicide tendency and sexual function. The initial results of this trial indicate that ansofaxine (80, 160 mg per day) was effective and safe 3 in the treatment of adult MDD patients.
