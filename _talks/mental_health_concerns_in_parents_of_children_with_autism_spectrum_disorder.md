Objective: This study aims to explore the mental health of parents whose child has been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).  
Methods: Mental health problems were assessed using the Korean-Symptom Check List 95 (K-SCL95), a self-report questionnaire that screens for 20 mental health conditions. Parents were divided into two groups depending on the presence of mental health problems. Independent t-tests and ANCOVA were used to explore the clinical characteristics between the groups. 
Results: A total of 186 parents (120 with and 86 without mental health problems) of children with ASD were included. The group with mental health problems scored higher in self-rating scales of social communication, rigid personality, and pragmatic language difficulties (p-values < .001~.011). No significant differences in the childâ€™s ASD-related symptoms were found between the groups. 
Conclusion: Parents of children with ASD also require support to address difficulties with mental health.
