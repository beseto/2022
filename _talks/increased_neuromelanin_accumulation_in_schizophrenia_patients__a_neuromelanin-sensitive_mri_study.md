Objective: To examine the neuromelanin (NM) levels of schizophrenia and to determine whether the levels are related to symptom scores
Methods: We acquired NM-MRI data from 30 schizophrenia patients (average age 25.50; % male 50) and 64 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (24.25; 46.88). We calculated the contrast ratio by placing a circular mask on the substantia nigra (SN) and crus cerebri. The contrast ratio was compared between groups, and correlation with symptomatic scores was investigated in schizophrenia patients.
Results: In schizophrenia, the contrast ratio of the SN was increased compared to the healthy controls (p = 0.042, Cohen's d = 0.425). There was no correlation between the contrast ratio and symptom score in schizophrenia patients. 
Conclusion: These results are in line with previous studies reporting increased NM and excessive dopamine production in the SN. This study proposes the possibility of using NM changes as a biomarker for schizophrenia.
