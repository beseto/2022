The current research aimed to explore if frequent participation in group-based exercise can predict better executive function performance in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Furthermore, we aimed to explore whether this relationship is mediated by white matter regions associated with the cerebellum (ROI). 30 typically developing (TD) children and 46 children with ADHD participated in the current study. A two-way ANCOVA revealed an interaction effect that approached significance (p=0.057). A further t-test revealed that those who frequently participated in group exercise performed significantly better in executive function than those who didn’t, only in the ADHD group.  Analysis involving the ROI revealed that medial lemniscus (left) (β=0.09**, p=0.004) and pontine crossing tract (left) (β=0.07*, p=0.036) volumes have a significant mediating effect on the executive function performance. The results revealed that the effects of frequent participation in group-based exercise on executive functioning was mediated by several regions associated with the cerebellum.
