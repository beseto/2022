We explored the FER functions, white matter microstructure (WMS), and their relationship in medication-naïve and comorbidity-free autism spectrum disorder (ASD) individuals. Fifty-nine participants with ASD and 59 age- and IQ-matched typically developed (TD) individuals were included, where 46 ASD and 50 TD individuals completed FER tasks. Covariance analysis was used to analyze the differences in FER between groups, and 2(group)×2(emotion category) repeated-measures ANOVA was used to compare the differences between basic and complex FER tasks. In addition, Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) was used to investigate the differences in Fractional anisotropy (FA), and partial correlation analyses were performed with FA and FER tasks. Compared with the TD group, ASD individuals showed deficits in basic and complex FER, alterations of WMS, as well as the atypical relationship between them. ASD individuals have FER deficits and WMS alterations, where the latter is potentially among the neural mechanisms underlying the former in ASD.
