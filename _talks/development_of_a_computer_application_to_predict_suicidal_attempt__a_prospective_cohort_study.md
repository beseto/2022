Objectives: We established a prediction model for suicide-attempts, validated it in an independent cohort, and developed a computerized prediction program. 
Methods: For suicidal ideators and attempters in Korean COhort Model Predicting Suicide and Suicidal-behavior(K-COMPASS) during 2015.11~2019.7, we performed logistic regression for suicide-attempts within 6months. We validated this model in an independent cohort during 2019.8~2022.6. Meanwhile, another model was constructed using self-report scales to develop a risk prediction application without professional assessment.
Results: Among 800 participants, 452 followed-up until 6 months, and 32 attempted suicide. Accuracy was AUC=0.824, PPV=17.67%, sensitivity=0.723 and specificity=0.841. Meanwhile, among 432 in validation cohort, 128 followed-up and 6 attempted suicides by 6months. Accuracy of our model in the validation cohort was AUC=0.771, sensitivity = 1.00 and specificity=0.578.
Accuracy of self-report model was AUC=0.834, PPV=9.69%, sensitivity=0.894 and specificity=0.698 in the original cohort; AUC=0.725, sensitivity=0.571, and specificity=0.532 in validation cohort.
Conclusion: Our program could be widely used in mental-healthcare blind-spots such as military or prison.
