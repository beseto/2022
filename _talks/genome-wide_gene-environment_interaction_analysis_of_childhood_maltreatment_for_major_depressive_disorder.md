The etiology of most psychiatric diseases involves genetic variants, environmental factors, and gene-environment interaction (G Ã— E) effects. Exposure to childhood maltreatment (CM) at any point during development can result in long-lasting consequences, including increasing disease vulnerability and illness severity in major depressive disorder (MDD). The current study conducted a genome-wide-CM interaction analysis based on SPAGE method with UK Biobank as the discovery sample and the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study as validation sample. Results identified two interaction loci for MDD (rs748174876 P=1.49E-08, and rs7233072 P=9.15E-06). The interaction effect between rs748174876 variant and CM significantly predicted incident MDD, and the interaction effect between rs7233072 and CM significantly predicted external behavior problem in adolescence and fluid intelligence/reasoning in adult. In conclusion, individuals with deletion variant in rs748174876 and GG genotype in rs7233072 were more susceptible to MDD once they experienced CM.
