**Objective** Predicting resistance to usual treatment from the beginning of psychotic disorder is important for improving prognosis, however, biomarkers to predict treatment resistance in early psychosis have not yet been sufficiently investigated. Thus, we investigated whether patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP) who later were classified as treatment-resistant (TRs) and not as treatment-resistant (non-TRs) have different cortical gyrification patterns compared to healthy controls (HCs).

**Methods** A total of 101 FEP patients and 101 matched HCs underwent T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. FEP patients were provided antipsychotic medication during their follow-up period. TR was defined when a patient was taking clozapine or showing moderate to severe symptoms were present despite of taking more than 2 types of antipsychotics in sufficient amounts and duration at their last follow-up point. The mean follow-up duration was 67 months. Cortical gyrification was calculated using local gyrification index (lGI) in a vertexwise fashion across the entire cortical surface and compared across the TRs, non-TRs, and HCs.

**Results** TRs exhibited significant reduction in cortical gyrification compared to HCs in clusters including precuneus, cuneus, and lingual gyri. Meanwhile, non-TRs exhibited significantly reduced cortical gyrification than HCs in clusters including precentral and postcentral areas.

**Conclusion** Our findings of different gyrification patterns between TRs and non-TRs suggest that different neurodevelopment abnormalities may underlie TRs and non-TRs. These results suggest that cortical gyrification could be a biomarker for predicting treatment resistance to usual antipsychotic medication from the beginning of psychotic disorders which may aid treatment strategies to TRs to improve their prognosis.
