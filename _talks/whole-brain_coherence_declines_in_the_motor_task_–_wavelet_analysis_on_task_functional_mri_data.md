Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides insights into the dynamic nature of brain function. Although there is an abundant accumulation of knowledge in brain science using fMRI, the dynamic global synchronicity of brain activity is still unclear. To address this issue, we assessed the synchronicity of the brain using wavelet coherence analysis of BOLD signals. We used 1053 task fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) database and calculated the synchronicity change of whole-brain BOLD signals between task and resting blocks. We found that whole-brain synchronicity declines during motor tasks compared to resting states. Synchronicity decline was prominent in functionally primitive brain networks such as visual and motor networks. It was not so significant in functionally high-order brain networks such as default mode networks (DMN) and frontoparietal networks. We can assume that the whole brain, incredibly primitive brain networks, reduces their synchronicity in task states to adapt to the environment efficiently.
