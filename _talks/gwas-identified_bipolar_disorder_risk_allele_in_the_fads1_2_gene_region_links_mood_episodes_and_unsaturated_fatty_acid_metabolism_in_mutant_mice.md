Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) on bipolar disorder (BD) have implicated the involvement of the fatty acid desaturase (FADS) locus. These enzymes (FADS1 and FADS2) are involved in the metabolism of EPA and DHA. To model reductions in the activity of FADS1/2 affected by the susceptibility alleles, we generated mutant mice heterozygous lacking both Fads1/2 genes. We measured wheel-running activity over six months and observed bipolar swings in activity, including hyperactivity and hypoactivity. The hyperactivity episodes, in which activity was far above the norm, usually lasted half a day. The hypoactivity episodes lasted for several weeks. Supplementation with DHA prevented these episodic behavioral changes. Here we propose that heterozygous Fads1/2 knockout mice are a model of BD with three validity, as administration of the mood stabilizer lithium was also effective. This GWAS-based model helps to clarify how lipids and their metabolisms are involved in the pathogenesis and treatment of BD.
