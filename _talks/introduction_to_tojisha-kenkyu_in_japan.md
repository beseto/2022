The term "tojisha-kenkyu" is made up of two Japanese words: "tojisha" and "kenkyu." Tojisha means a person with various difficulties such as disabilities, illness, deprivation, stigma and so on. Kenkyu means research or study. In short, tojisha-kenkyu is a practice in which people with difficulties do not outsource the exploration of the mechanisms of their difficulties and coping methods to specialists, but rather become researchers themselves and conduct research together with their peers who have similar difficulties. The "tojisha-kenkyu" was born in 2001 at "Urakawa Bethel House," which has continued discharge support and community life support for people with mental disabilities in Hokkaido, under the influence of social movements by patients with intractable diseases and people with physical disabilities, and self-help groups by people with addictions. The experiences of people with mental disabilities were largely unknown to the neighbourhood and were easily misunderstood and stigmatized. Bethel House has changed people's perceptions, attitudes, and behaviours by creating a language to express the experiences of people with mental disabilities through-kenkyu, and by disseminating this language to society at large. Since then, tojisha-kenkyu has been spreading not only to mental disorders but also to various areas of hardship, such as neurodiversity and chronic pain. More recently, it is also spreading to people without disabilities or illnesses, such as parents struggling to raise children, children who have trouble adjusting to school, college students with problems, and workers under stress. In addition, researchers in various fields such as medicine, cognitive science, engineering, architecture, social science, and philosophy are collaborating with tojisha-kenkyu. Thus, there are three aspects to tojisha-kenkyu: 1) self-help methods, 2) social/organizational change methods, and 3) participatory/emancipatory research methods. In this talk, each of these aspects will be introduced with specific examples.
