**Objective:** To understand the link between hypertension and Alzheimer disease, this cross-sectional study examined the relationships of hypertension history and current blood pressure (BP) with in vivo β-amyloid (Aβ) and tau deposition, and whether hypertension history and current BP modulate the relationship between Aβ and tau.

**Methods:** All 68 cognitively normal older adults underwent both Aβ and tau positron emission tomography, as well as clinical assessment of hypertension history and current BP.

**Results:** Using linear regression models, neither the history nor current BP had direct association with Aβ or tau. However, the synergistic interaction effects of high current systolic and diastolic BP with Aβ on tau were significant, whereas there was no such effect for history of hypertension.

**Conclusion:** High current BP, but not hypertension history, modulate the relationship between cerebral Aβ and tau deposition in late-life, and thus strict BP control is warranted in cognitively normal older adults with hypertension.
