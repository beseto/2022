Adolescence is a crucial line stage when psychological difficulties are likely to be experienced with rapid brain development. Mismatch negativity (MMN) and gamma-band auditory steady-state response (ASSR) are representative EEG indices that reflect adolescent brain development. In our study, EEG measurements and assessment of psychological difficulties were performed on participants selected from the general population in a large-scale population-based adolescent cohort study. We investigated change of EEG indices between 2 time points (N = 67, mean age: 13.4 and 16.1 years, respectively), and examined the relationship between change in EEG indices and change in psychological difficulties in longitudinal design. As a result, while there were no significant differences in the EEG indices over time, we found that decrease of duration MMN amplitude was associated with increase in psychological difficulties. This suggests that the development of MMN amplitude that reflects glutamatergic neurotransmission during adolescence is related to psychological difficulty.
