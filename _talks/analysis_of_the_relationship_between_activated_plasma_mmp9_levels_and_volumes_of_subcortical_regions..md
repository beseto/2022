Matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) is an enzyme involved in the degradation of the extracellular matrix in human physiological processes. MMP9 is expressed in some brain regions including hippocampus, and it influences learning and memory processes. Recently, it has been reported that plasma MMP9 levels in schizophrenia were significantly higher than in healthy controls, and they were negatively correlated with bilateral hippocampal volumes. However, the associations of activated plasma MMP9 levels and volumes of subcortical regions including hippocampus remains elusive. Thus, we investigated whether activated plasma MMP9 levels are associated with volumes of subcortical regions including hippocampus and using blood samples and T1-weighted MRI images of 28 patients with schizophrenia and 50 healthy controls. MRI images were analyzed with FreeSurfer software. Activated plasma MMP9 levels were negatively associated with volumes of right hippocampus in the schizophrenia group, while they were not associated with volumes of any subcortical region in healthy controls. These results suggest that activated MMP9 may break down the brain extracellular matrix, leading to brain volume reduction of right hippocampus in schizophrenia.
