**Object:** This study thus aimed to review the contents and CBT techniques used in previously reported CBT programs for IA/IGD. 

**Method:** A database search of Ovid/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochran, CINAHL, PsychINFO, WOS was conducted for IA/IGD CBT interventions. A total of 4860 articles were identified, and 22 articles were included in the study criteria. CBT techniques used in programs were identified and categorized by two separate psychiatrists. 

**Results:** Programs varied in length, from 4 to 24 sessions. The time spent on each session also varied from 40 to 120 minutes. Among techniques used in CBT, problem solving skill training was the most widely used, and cognitive reconstruction was the second most widely used. Time spent in behavioral therapy was longer than that in cognitive therapy in general. 

**Conclusion:** CBT programs for IA/IGD varied in session length and included CBT techniques. Programs were usually more focused on behavioral therapy. Theory and evidence-based standardization of IA/IGD CBT programs is required.
