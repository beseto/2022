**Objective** To investigate the prevalence of comorbid tic disorders in individuals with ASD using standardized assessment methods. Secondly, to explore differences in ASD symptom severity and other comorbidities.

**Methods** We included individuals diagnosed with ASD (n = 679) aged 4 to 18 years who completed the YGTSS questionnaire. Based on the YGTSS score, the included individuals were divided into two groups: ASD only (n = 554) and ASD with tics (n = 125).

**Results** The ASD with tics group had a significantly higher average age and full-scale IQ score than the ASD only group. Regarding clinical characteristics, the ASD with tics group showed significantly higher SRS-2, CBCL, and YBOCS subdomain scores after adjusting for age. Individuals with a higher IQ (IQ â‰¥70) showed a significantly greater proportion of tic symptoms.

**Conclusions** The severity of ASD core and comorbid symptoms is associated with tic disorders and severity among affected individuals.
