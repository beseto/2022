**Objective**: To explore the attitude and perception of physicians on early diagnosis and treatment of AD in China. 

**Methods:** Six hundred fisty-nine physicians participated in the nationwide cross-sectional survey.

**Results:** Approximately half of the participants knew that amyloid PET imaging (44%) or CSF biomarker testing (52.5%) could facilitate the early diagnosis of AD. However, less than one-fifth often used amyloid PET imaging (18%) or CSF biomarker testing (19.2%) for diagnosis. Nearly 46% of the participants were not willing to diagnose AD in the early stage unless there were effective therapies for early AD. Besides, about 70.6% of participants considered that the lack of harmonized references of the biomarker assays remained a vital drawback to utilize biomarkers in clinical practice of early diagnosis.

**Conclusion:** The rate of being willing to and utilizing biomarkers for diagnosis early AD remained low among experienced physicians in China.
