Objective This study aims to investigate whether verbal fluency task measure other than word count could be a predictor of prognosis, especially remission, of individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis.
Methods 127 CHR individuals and 178 healthy controls underwent verbal fluency task. Semantic clusters in individual task response were extracted, using Korean word embedding model. Word count, average cluster size, and maximum cluster size were put into binomial logistic regression model to verify if each of the variables predict conversion or remission of CHRs.
Results Logistic regression analysis revealed that word count of verbal fluency task response could only predict conversion at baseline. For non-converters, average and maximum size of semantic clusters were able to significantly distinguish remitters from non-remitters.
Conclusion This study suggests that verbal fluency task measures that are more related to semantic organization than word count could be a predictor of remission of CHR individuals.
