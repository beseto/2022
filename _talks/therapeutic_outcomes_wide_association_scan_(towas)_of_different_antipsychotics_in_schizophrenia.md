Background: We aimed to identify discrepant therapeutic outcomes among different antipsychotics in a RCT. 
Methods: A total of 3030 patients with schizophrenia from a RCT were enrolled as discovery cohort, and 1395 patients as validation cohorts. TOWAS was conducted to scan differentiate outcomes of 209 therapeutic outcomes across antipsychotics. 
Outcomes: Olanzapine significantly related to higher risk of AIWG, liver dysfunction, sedation, increased lipid, and lower risk of EPS. Risperidone related to higher risk of HPRL. Quetiapine related to higher risk of sedation, palpitation, increased lipid, lower risk of HPRL, and EPS. Aripiprazole related to lower risk of HPRL, AIWG, sedation, and QTc prolongation. Ziprasidone related to higher risk of increased QT, nausea, lower risk of AIWG, liver dysfunction, and increased lipid. Haloperidol related to higher risk of EPS, HPRL, and increased salivation. Perphenazine related to higher risk of EPS. 
Conclusion: Further independent RCT-designed cohort is necessary for validation.
