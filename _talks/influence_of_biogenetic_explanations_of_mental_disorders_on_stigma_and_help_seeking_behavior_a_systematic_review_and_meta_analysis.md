Objectives: Biogenetic causal explanations of mental disorders are commonly used for public education and campaigns. However, the influence of biogenetic explanations on the ideas about and attitudes toward mental illness is unclear. We examined the influence of biogenetic explanations on attitudes toward mental disorders using a meta-analytic method accompanied by subgroup analyses. 
Methods: Experimental and correlational studies were analyzed separately. Five outcome measures related to attitudes toward mental disorders were included: ‘attitude toward help-seeking’, ‘blame’, ‘perceived dangerousness’, ‘prognostic pessimism’, and ‘social distance’. Subgroup analyses were performed for the type of mental disorder, population, and geographic region for which a biogenetic explanation was provided.
Results: A total of 44 studies were included, of which 24 were experimental and 20 were correlational. A positive attitude toward help-seeking was associated with having a biogenetic concept (d = 0.43, P < 0.001) in general population and in Eastern countries in particular. Although a biogenetic explanation was associated with a decreased level of blame (d = −0.20, P = 0.03) in the general population, it was also associated with significantly higher levels of perceived dangerousness (d = 0.13, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.23, P = 0.008). A tendency toward a higher level of prognostic pessimism and social distance was associated with a biogenetic concept of mental disorders although there was no statistical significance. 
Conclusions: Although a biogenetic explanation promotes public use of mental health services, it should be carefully applied to avoid an increase in negative thoughts, such as that mental illness is biologically irreversible and untreatable.
