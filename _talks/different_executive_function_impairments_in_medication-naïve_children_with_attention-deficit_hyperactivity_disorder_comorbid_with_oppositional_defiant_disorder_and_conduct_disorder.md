Introduction: Disruptive behavior disorders (DBD), including oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and conduct disorder (CD), is the most common comorbidity in ADHD. Few studies have separated ADHD with CD (ADHDCD+) and ADHD with ODD (ADHDODD+) when studying the executive functions (EFs) and brain imaging of ADHD with DBD (ADHDDBD+).
Methods: EFs difference were compared in 1,026 ADHDDBD+ (104 ADHDCD+, 922 ADHDODD+), 1,026 ADHDonly and 406 healthy controls (HCs). Brain activation of 164 children with ADHD were also measured to investigate the neural basis with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS),
Results: No EFs impairment was seen between ADHDCD+ and HCs. More severe CD symptoms were associated with better EFs. The relationship between CD symptoms and inhibition function was mediated by the FC of SMN(L) - DMN(R).
Conclusion: ADHDCD+ and ADHDODD+ showed difference in EFs impairment. The comorbid of CD may not worsen the impairments, even be with better EFs performance within ADHD individuals.
