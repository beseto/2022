**Objective:** We aimed to determine the relationship between REM sleep without atonia (RSWA) and neurocognitive function among patients with idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD). 

**Methods:** We retrospectively analyzed the baseline polysomnographic recordings and neurocognitive data of 45 Korean iRBD patients. The quantitative analysis of electromyography during REM sleep was performed by manual method, according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) manual for scoring sleep, 2007. Neurocognitive data included both quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) and neuropsychological measures. 

**Results:** Patients with high phasic RSWA showed poorer performance in digit span forward (p=0.008), increased absolute delta power in temporal (p=0.045) and parietal (p=0.035) regions, and increased absolute theta power in parietal (p=0.035) regions. However, patients with high tonic RSWA got lower scores only in trail-making test B (p=0.009). Also, phasic RSWA was significantly correlated with absolute delta and theta power, categorical fluency, and mini-mental state examination (MMSE-KC). Regarding tonic RSWA, there was no significant correlation other than Boston naming test. 

**Conclusion:** This study suggests that phasic rather than tonic RSWA reflects changes in the underlying neurocognitive function of iRBD patients.
