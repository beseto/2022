People with epilepsy (PWE) are more likely to suffer from psychiatric disorders than healthy people, but the number of psychiatrists who treat epilepsy is decreasing in Japan. Psychiatric symptoms comorbid with epilepsy cannot be accurately assessed without some evaluation of epileptic seizures. Therefore, in order to increase the number of psychiatrists who can see PWE with psychiatric comorbidities in the future, training in an environment where both psychiatric and seizure symptoms of PWE can be evaluated is essential. The Department of Neuropsychiatry at the University of Tokyo Hospital uses a room in an open ward as an epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) where long-term video EEG monitoring (LVEEG) can be performed, and patients requiring evaluation of seizure symptoms are regularly admitted. In this presentation, we will introduce the EMU in our department with the outcomes of patients admitted to the EMU.
