Objective: Despite functional dysconnectivity and altered white matter (WM) integrity of frontoparietal regions, the anatomical profile of the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) remains unclear in the complex pathophysiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Thus, we aimed to examine the WM integrity of SLF I, II, and III in patients with OCD.  
Methods: 90 unmedicated OCD patients and 81 healthy controls (HCs) were scanned with diffusion weighted imaging. We conducted whole-brain tractography and virtual dissections of SLF subdivisions. Averaged diffusion measures were extracted from each SLF subdivision and compared between groups.
Results: No significant difference was found in all diffusion measures of SLF subdivisions between the OCD patients and HCs.
Conclusion: We indicate no substantial change in WM integrity of frontoparietal connections in OCD patients. Given the large sample size and reliable method, we suggest that rather the aberrant WM projections, altered cortical function in frontoparietal regions may primarily underlie the OCD pathophysiology.
