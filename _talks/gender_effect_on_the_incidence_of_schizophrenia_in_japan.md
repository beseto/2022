Gender difference is reported in incidence of schizophrenia. Attention was focused on biological factors such as sex hormones. However, the role of gender has not been fully examined. Although Japan is considered as one of the most gender-disparate countries, there are changes over time and regional differences in several indicators of gender inequality.
To infer the influence of social gender on the development of schizophrenia, we examined correlations of female-male ratio in the schizophrenia incidence and social gender gap indicators in Japan by prefecture. Random forest model was used to infer the influence of social gender on the development of schizophrenia.
The decrease in the female-male ratio of incidence of schizophrenia was negatively correlated with the number of people outside the labor force.
These findings indicate that social gender may have an influence on gender differences in the incidence of schizophrenia. It might provide clues to understanding the influence of individual-society interactions on the development of mental disorders.
