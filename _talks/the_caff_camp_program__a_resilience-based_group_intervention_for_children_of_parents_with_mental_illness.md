Children of parents with mental illness (COPMI) may encounter multiple difficulties as they grow up and have higher risks of developing their own mental health problems. Prevention programs can help impede the transmission of mental illness from parents to children. With general aims of fostering resilience and cultivating hope, we held several CAFF peer-support programs for children and adolescents aged 8-17 years living in families affected by parental mental illness. We employed a mixed-methods approach to evaluate outcomes from a pilot multi-site implementation of the CAFF program. Quantitative data: Participants scored 43.3±17.2 in the Mental Health Test, with 48.9% participants showing problems in learning anxiety. Their general family function was 2.02±0.56 in Family Assessment Device. Several participants with suspicious symptoms were referred to child psychiatrists. Qualitative data: Participants reported “feeling loved” (74.6%), “being connected” (51.7%), “boosting confidence”, and “having fun” in the program.
