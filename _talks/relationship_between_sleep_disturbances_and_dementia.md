Sleep patterns change as people age. Compared with younger adults, older adults experience worse sleep quality and have more sleep disturbances. Specifically, insomnia and sleep disordered breathing (SDB) are two common problems that affect older adults. Sleep plays an important role in cognitive processing, and sleep disturbances can lead to impairments in cognitive performance in the elderly. Studies also show that sleep disturbances may be associated with the incident of dementia, however, the results are inconsistent and a comprehensive examination of the predictive role of sleep disturbances in incident dementia is lacking. Thus we conducted a meta-analysis assessing the links between overall sleep disturbances, the most common sleep complaints (i.e., insomnia and SDB), and several types of dementia (all-cause, Alzheimer's disease [AD], and vascular dementia). We found that sleep disturbances may predict the risk of incident dementia. Moreover, insomnia was associated only with incident AD, and SDB was a risk factor of all-cause dementia, AD, and vascular dementia. To further realize the potential mechanism of sleep disturbances and dementia, we analyzed the associations of sleep disturbances and amyloid burden in the brain using data of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. Sleep problems were not associated with high amyloid burden in the whole population, however, in the APOE4+ group, sleep problems could affect regional amyloid burden in many brain regions, including hippocampus. In future, more studies are needed to confirm the relationship between sleep disturbances and dementia and explore the underlying mechanisms.
