Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is widely known to be effective in improving mental illness, physical illness, and well-being. It is pursued in various settings, including medical care, welfare, education, and industry. Starting in FY2011, the Japanese Ministry of Health Labour and Welfare organized a CBT training program, allowing nationwide specialist training. However, where a typical CBT session lasts 30-50 minutes and the average outpatient time is less than 10 minutes, it is challenging for physicians to conduct CBT in their limited clinic time. Consequently, CBT is inadequately implemented in Japan. Several reasons hinder the widespread use of CBT, one of which is the lack of therapists.ã€€Streamlined CBT (SCBT) was developed to solve this problem, enabling one to perform CBT in a 15-minute session. This presentation will discuss the tips employed and materials designed in this attempt, with an introduction to the feasibility study currently underway.
