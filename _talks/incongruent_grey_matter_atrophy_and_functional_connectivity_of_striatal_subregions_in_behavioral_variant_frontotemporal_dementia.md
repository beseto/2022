**Objective:** To explore the structure and function of striatal subregions in bvFTD.

**Methods:** We acquired T1 and fMRI data from 26 bvFTD patients and 36 control subjects. We used VBM and RSFC analyses to study group differences in striatal subregions. Correlation analyses were used to investigate the relationship between imaging and neuropsychological tests.

**Results:** The patients of bvFTD had smaller volumes of striatal subregions than the controls. And we found that the ventral atrophy was greater than dorsal atrophy, and the right greater than the left. Functional imaging analysis revealed that bvFTD patients exhibited different changed patterns in striatal subregions compared to controls, and the RSFC extending range on the right was greater than that on the left in the same subregions. The dorsolateral putamen nucleus was involved in executive function regulation.

**Conclusion:** This suggests that incongruent structural and functional changes in striatal subregions may underly the bvFTD cognitive deficit.
